## 🎯 Vibe Coding Process

This project was created using the vibe coding methodology:

1. **Initial Prompt to Claude**: "Create a birthday countdown to March 15, 2025 with falling confetti animation"
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Tested in Claude Artifacts with instant preview
3. **Enhancement Prompts**: 
   - "Make the confetti more colorful"
   - "Add glassmorphism effect to the time boxes"
   - "Make it mobile responsive"
4. **Ported to Windsurf**: Transferred code to IDE for version control
5. **Final Touches**: Added custom birthday input and localStorage

Total development time: **15 minutes** from idea to deployment!

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/birthday-countdown.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

That's it! No build process or dependencies required.

## 🎨 Customization

### Change the Birthday Date

Edit line 123 in `index.html`:
```javascript

const colors = ['#f44336', '#e91e63', '#9c27b0', ...];
```

### Adjust Confetti Amount

Change the confetti count on line 85:
```javascript
const confettiCount = 150; // Increase for more confetti!
```
